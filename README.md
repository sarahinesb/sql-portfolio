# SQL Portfolio

This repository contains SQL projects demonstrating data analysis and database design skills.

## Projects

### 1. Cafe Sales
- The Dirty Cafe Sales dataset includes 10,000 simulated cafe sales transactions. It was purposely designed with missing data, inconsistencies, and errors to replicate real-world data challenges
- Used SQL to: Standardize and rename columns for consistency. Clean missing, blank, and invalid values (UNKNOWN, ERROR). Recalculate missing Total_Spent values. Create a trigger to automate future total calculations. Optimize and correct data types. Identify duplicate Transaction_ID records.

### 2. Customer Spending
- The Customer Spending dataset contains data on customer demographics, income levels, spending patterns, and purchasing behavior. It is designed to support data analysis, predictive modeling, and customer segmentation projects.
- Used SQL to: Analyze average income and spending by gender. Create and join a continent lookup table. Compare average income by continent and income level vs purchase frequency. Evaluate education level vs income groups. Analyze education vs purchase frequency. Segment customers by age groups. Identify top 10 countries by average spending. Perform customer segmentation. Conduct generational analysis. 

### 3. Global Ads Performance (Google, Meta, TikTok) / Case Study
- This dataset contains campaign-level advertising performance data from Google Ads, Meta Ads, and TikTok Ads. It is used for marketing analytics, performance optimization, budget allocation, and platform comparison analysis.
- Used SQL to: Compare ROAS and CPA performance across platforms. Analyze revenue, clicks, conversions, and ad spend efficiency. Evaluate campaign scalability and optimization opportunities. Identify top and bottom performing campaigns.

### 4. Zara Sales
